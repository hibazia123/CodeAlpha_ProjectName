The Banking System is a C++ console application developed as part of my internship tasks. It is designed using Object-Oriented Programming principles and includes classes such as Customer, Account, and Transaction.
The system provides core banking functionalities including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and transaction history management. This project demonstrates practical implementation of OOP concepts and data management in C++.
