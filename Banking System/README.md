💳 Banking System – C++ (Internship Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a console-based Banking System developed in C++ as part of my internship task.
The system is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and simulates core banking operations such as account management and transaction handling.

It demonstrates practical implementation of classes, encapsulation, data management, and real-time transaction recording.

🏗️ System Architecture

The application is structured using three main classes:

1️⃣ Customer

Stores customer ID and name

Manages multiple bank accounts

Allows account creation

2️⃣ Account

Maintains account number and balance

Handles deposits and withdrawals

Supports fund transfers between accounts

Stores transaction history

3️⃣ Transaction

Records transaction type

Stores amount

Captures date and time of transaction

⚙️ Features Implemented

✔ Create new customers
✔ Create multiple accounts per customer
✔ Deposit funds
✔ Withdraw funds with balance validation
✔ Transfer money between accounts
✔ Maintain transaction history
✔ Display account balance and details
✔ Menu-driven user interface

💡 OOP Concepts Used

Classes & Objects

Encapsulation

Abstraction

Composition (Customer → Account → Transaction)

Dynamic data storage using STL vector

🛠️ Technologies Used

C++

Standard Template Library (STL)

Console-based interface

▶ How to Run the Program

Compile the program using any C++ compiler:

g++ banking_system.cpp -o banking_system

Run the executable:

./banking_system
📚 Learning Outcomes

Applied Object-Oriented Programming in a real-world scenario

Implemented transaction tracking logic

Managed relationships between multiple classes

Strengthened understanding of STL containers
